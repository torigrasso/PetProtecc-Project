        <p>I always wanted a cat, but I never expected to get a best friend. The best part about adopting Zeppelin was that I didn’t choose him, he chose me. I wanted to change his life, but he’s changed mine.</p>

        <p>Sarah and CJ</p>
        <p>We’ve had Roo for a little over 7 months now and he’s brought nothing but joy and excitement to our lives! He makes every hard day 10x’s times better, bathing us with kisses and cuddles. His personality is like no other and we are so blessed to have been the ones to adopt and love him forever!</p>

        <p>This is me and Ziggy. He’s just as crazy as me but also loves naps and cuddling. He changed my life. I am not sure who saved who.</p>

        <p>I never knew this little weirdo would make my day everyday. She is the best shotgun rider and little babe I could have ever ask for. I am so proud to be her dog mom.</p>

        <p>The unconditional love that Boo and Arthur give to me is simply irreplaceable. Between their wrestling at 3AM, their exuberant personalities and the naps we take together, I couldn’t imagine my life without them.</p>
