           <ul>
               <li >Of the 3 million cats and dogs euthanized in shelters each year, approximately 2.4 million (80%) are healthy and treatable and could have been adopted into new homes.</li>
               <li>Approximately 7.6 million companion animals enter animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.4 million are cats.</li>
               <li>Even though the American Kennel Club doesn’t recognize pit bulls as a distinct breed, dogs that have “pit bull type” characteristics generally face higher rates of euthanasia, based on a perception of them as dangerous and unadoptable. In places with pit bull bans or Breed Specific Legislation, these dogs may be confiscated from their human companions and euthanized without recourse.</li>
               <li>Each year, approximately 2.7 million animals are euthanized (1.4 million cats).</li>
               <li>Approximately 2.7 million shelter animals are adopted each year (1.3 million cats).</li>
               <li>One of the top ten reasons pets are surrendered is for behavior. What's more is that according to a study done in 2018, up to 96% of all dogs turned in had not recived behavior training.</li>
               <li>Of the cats entering shelters, approximately 37% are adopted, 41% are euthanized, and less than 5% of cats who came in as strays are returned to their owners.</li>
               <li>Gregariousness and friendliness can be beneficial in attracting people to adopt dogs. One study found that dogs who received positive human contact from shelter workers (and toys) increased the time they spent at the front quarter of their pen when humans were close. Spending time at the front of the pen can increase chances of adoption more than dogs who may be cowering at the back, or defensively barking.</li>
               <li>While many think senior animals are not adoptable simply due to age, it should be noted that these animals make great matches for the right family. Age does not make these animals grumpy, it usually makes them lower maintenance and more laid back!</li>
