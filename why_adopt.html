	<p><b>Many are wary of the longstanding effects of adopting an animal rather than purchasing one from a chain or a breeder. Below are a list of benefits that will undoubtedly relieve you of any doubt you may have!</b><br>
		<ul>
		<li>The cost of adoption is drastically lower than that of purchasing.</li>
			<li>Most animals who have been housed in shelters have already received their vaccines and are neutered/spayed.</li>
			<li>You are helping erradicate puppy mills instead of funding their future abuse of innumberable animals.</li>
			<li>You'll always have someone that loves you unconditionally; waiting for you to come every day.</li>
			<li>Pets are a great way to connect with new people who share a passion for the love of their fur baby.</li>
			<li>You will be saving the life of an animal that is capable of bringing you an immense amount of laughter and bed time cuddles.</li>
